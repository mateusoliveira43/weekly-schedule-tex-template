TeX template that I made for organize my weekly schedule, based in a college's schedule grid.

# Features to be Implemented

# About the Template

To use it, you have to fill the `semester` and `user` variables, in the `Usage Changes` section. You can change a specific color or add a new one, following the template's examples. For the colors, pass it's RGB values. 

Then, add your schedules in the right position of the weekly schedule's table, located at the `Template's Body` section, and their labels in the label's table, following the template's examples.

Regarding the comments, I have a personal taste for this style (60 columns length and centralized text), I think it catches the user's attention.
